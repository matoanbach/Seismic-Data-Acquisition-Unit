# Seismic Data Acquisition Unit

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a Seismic Data Acquisition Unit that integrates with a seismic transducer to collect and transmit seismic data to data centers. The aim is to facilitate the real-time monitoring and analysis of seismic activities, which is crucial for understanding geological phenomena and their potential impacts.

## Business Case
Capturing and analyzing seismic data is essential for geological monitoring and understanding tectonic movements. Our solution involves a robust data acquisition system that not only captures data efficiently but also ensures its secure transmission to prevent unauthorized access and data manipulation.

## System Requirements
- **Data Retrieval:** Fast and efficient retrieval of data from the transducer.
- **Subscription Management:** Handle subscription requests from data centers securely via password authentication.
- **Data Transmission:** Reliable transmission of data to all subscribed data centers, with acceptable levels of data loss in high-throughput scenarios.
- **Security:** Robust security measures to prevent brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.

## Design
### Transducer
- Converts seismic waves into binary data streams.
- Data written into shared memory for high-speed transfer.
- Transducer and data acquisition software run concurrently for efficient data sharing.

### Seismic Data Acquisition Unit
- Retrieves data from shared memory, ensuring data is synchronized with transducer output.
- Uses INET datagram sockets for network communication.
- Employs mutexes for data synchronization between retrieval and transmission processes.
- Tracks data center activities to identify and mitigate potential security threats.

## Implementation
- **Shared Memory:** Manages seismic data in a circular buffer within shared memory.
- **Networking:** Utilizes INET datagram sockets for subscribing data centers and data transmission.
- **Security:** Implements mechanisms to authenticate data centers and safeguard against network attacks.

## Security Features
- **Password Protection:** Secure handling of passwords to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Attack Mitigation:** Systems in place to detect and block brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.

## Source Code
- Source files for the transducer and data acquisition unit include:
  - `SeismicData.h`
  - `Transducer.h`
  - `Transducer.cpp`
  - `TransducerMain.cpp`
  - `Makefile`, `start.bat`, `stop.bat` for operational control.

## Deployment
- Deploy the system in environments where seismic monitoring is critical, such as geological survey areas and near tectonic plate boundaries.
- Ensure all system components are properly configured and the network is secured.
